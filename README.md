# Project Roadmap (14 Weeks)

## Overview
This project focuses on building a scalable and secure platform using AWS SST, React, Tailwind, and ShadCN. The development is structured into five phases, covering learning, project setup, reporting, player management, security enhancements, and final deployment.

## Phases & Milestones

### Phase 1: Learning & Setup (Weeks 1-2)
- **Objective:** Establish the foundation with a team bootcamp and project boilerplate.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Backend: AWS SST, tRPC, ElectroDB, IAM, Cognito.
  - Frontend: React, Tailwind, ShadCN, tRPC.
  - Project Setup: Authentication, CI/CD, and Git workflows.

### Phase 2: Reports & Admin Panel (Weeks 3-5)
- **Objective:** Develop the reports framework and implement an admin control panel.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Create modular UI for reports (Players, Finance, Transactions).
  - Role-based user management and access control.

### Phase 3: Player & Transaction Management (Weeks 6-9)
- **Objective:** Implement player data management and financial transaction functionalities.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Search, filter, and edit player data.
  - Secure credit adjustments with an approval flow.
  - Develop a logging system for transactions and admin actions.

### Phase 4: Security Enhancements (Weeks 10-12)
- **Objective:** Strengthen security with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and audit logging.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Require MFA for privileged actions.
  - Implement a detailed audit log for admin activities.
  - Optimize security through API rate limits and IAM refinements.

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Weeks 13-14)
- **Objective:** Conduct comprehensive testing and deploy the platform.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - API testing (Jest) and UI testing (Cypress/Playwright).
  - Deploy backend on AWS and frontend on Vercel/AWS Amplify.
  - Set up monitoring with CloudWatch.

## Timeline Overview
Each phase follows a structured timeline, ensuring progressive development and milestone completion. The final two weeks focus on refining security, stability, and deployment strategies to ensure a robust platform launch.

## Conclusion
This roadmap ensures a structured approach to developing a secure and scalable platform with a focus on user management, financial transactions, and security best practices. The phased execution aligns with best development methodologies, ensuring efficiency and reliability.
